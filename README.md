In this notebook, we will explore several types of Regression models on a Medical Cost dataset found on Kaggle( https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance ) to see if we can predict if certain factors can predict medical costs. This data set shows individual medical costs as billed by insurance. The identity of each individual is hidden but some personal data is given such as: age, sex, BMI, how many children they have, if they are as smoker, and what region they are from. We have no data on the diagnosis of patients. But we have other information that can help us to make a conclusion about the health of patients and practice regression analysis.
